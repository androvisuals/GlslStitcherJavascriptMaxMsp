# GlslStitcherJavascriptMaxMsp
Max msp can't handle merging and manipulating GLSL and XML data in a simple manner due to reserved keywords and symbols. 

This javascript object will allow a user to specify a folder and merge together the XML header - ALL glsl files - xml footer , into one file so that the user can just edit one text file and then have everything merged together again.
